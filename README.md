## Advice generator app

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com).

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon
